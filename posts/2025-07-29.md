# First post?!  

It's fascinating discovering what can and (perhaps more importantly) cannot be done through the github GUI  
You can't rename directories, only delete and add them (and all their contents)  
You can't edit multiple files  

Interesting experiment, but I'll probably go back to using my normal text editor after this
